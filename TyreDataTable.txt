This document serves as a record of all known / recorded tyre compound temperature thresholds, as reported by Telemetry and optimised for H+ graphics.
Use these values for the corresponding Tire Temperature graphics (Cold and Hot) in order to switch to different compounds.
This serves as an interim solution until a more efficient / user friendly one is developed (Learning C# while doing 2 jobs is hard)

NOTE: Values may display be inaccurate in places - these will be retuned if required and mentioned in the Patch Notes. All values were recorded in a single session, using the 2016 Audi R8 for Semi Slicks and up, and the 2002 Acura RSX for Stock/Street/Sport. No parts / tuning of the car was changed except tyre compounds.
(Values are measured internally in Celsius - Trying to use Fahrenheit will break things.)

Data Values will follow the below format:
Cold(Blue) - Optimal(Lower Bound / Clear): Cold Side Graphics
Optimal(Upper Bound / Clear) - Hot(Yellow) - OVERHEAT(Red): Hot Side Graphics
